Uterus/adnexa: Normal appearance.

Lymph nodes: A few mildly enlarged lymph nodes noted in the portocaval, peripancreatic, and retroperitoneal areas, with the largest measuring up to 1.5 cm short axis, concerning for possible metastases.

Peritoneum: Trace amount of ascites seen in the pelvis and around the liver.

Bowel: Normal caliber. No evidence of obstruction. No obvious wall thickening.

Abdominal aorta: Normal caliber.

Inferior vena cava: Patent.

Abdominal wall: No abnormalities.

Osseous structures/soft tissues: No destructive bone lesions identified.

Lower chest: Small right pleural effusion present. Scattered atelectasis at the lung bases.

IMPRESSION:

Multiple hypodense hepatic lesions with peripheral rim enhancement and central hypoattenuation, concerning for metastatic disease. Tumor thrombus identified in the right and main portal veins. Mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation in the right lobe likely secondary to mass effect and vascular occlusion.

No prior imaging available for comparison. Primary malignancy unknown; differentials include GI, pancreatic, or colorectal origin.

Several mildly enlarged abdominal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, concerning for nodal metastases.

Small right pleural effusion and trace ascites, possibly related to hepatic disease.

Incidental small left adrenal nodule, probably benign, such as an adenoma.","Liver: Hepatomegaly with heterogeneous parenchymal attenuation. Multiple hypodense lesions throughout both hepatic lobes, largest measuring 5.2 cm in segment 7 and 3.8 cm in segment 4A, demonstrating peripheral rim enhancement with central hypoattenuation on portal venous phase, consistent with metastatic disease. No prior imaging for comparison. Tumor thrombus is present in the right portal vein extending into the main portal vein, with associated mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation in the right lobe. No definitive hepatic capsular retraction or biliary stent.

Portal and hepatic veins: Main portal vein and right portal vein are occluded by tumor thrombus, with expansion of the vessel lumen. Left portal vein remains patent. Hepatic veins are patent but compressed by adjacent metastatic lesions.

Biliary system: Mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation in the right hepatic lobe, secondary to mass effect from adjacent metastases and portal vein occlusion. Common bile duct is normal in caliber at 5 mm.

Gallbladder: Unremarkable, no stones or wall thickening.

Pancreas: Unremarkable.

Spleen: Normal in size and appearance.

Adrenal glands: Small left adrenal nodule measuring 0.9 cm, indeterminate on non-contrast imaging but likely benign adenoma.

Kidneys: No mass, hydronephrosis, or nephrolithiasis.

Urinary bladder: Unremarkable.

Uterus/adnexa: Normal.

Lymph nodes: Multiple mildly enlarged portocaval, peripancreatic, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, largest measuring 1.5 cm short axis, suspicious for nodal metastases.

Peritoneum: Trace ascites noted in the perihepatic and pelvic recesses.

Bowel: Normal caliber without obstruction. No abnormal wall thickening.

Abdominal aorta: No aneurysm.

Inferior vena cava: Patent.

Abdominal wall: Unremarkable.

Osseous structures/soft tissues: No aggressive osseous lesions.

Lower chest: Small right pleural effusion. Scattered bibasilar atelectasis.

IMPRESSION:

Multiple hepatic metastases with tumor thrombus involving the right and main portal veins, resulting in mild right intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. No prior imaging available for comparison. Findings suggest metastatic disease from an unknown primary malignancy; consider upper GI, pancreaticobiliary, or colorectal origin given pattern.

Multiple mildly enlarged upper abdominal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, suspicious for nodal metastases.

Small right pleural effusion and trace ascites, likely secondary to hepatic metastatic disease.
